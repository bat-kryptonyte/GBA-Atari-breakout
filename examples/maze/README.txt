On the title screen, the program will transition to the maze screen after pressing 'START'.

On the maze screen, the program will display a maze with a small blue square in the bottom left corner, which acts as the player. The player cannot go through the maze walls and can move in all four directions using the arrow keys. 

In the bottom right corner, there is a large green box, and the player has 60 seconds to reach the green box to win. There is also a wall that blocks the player from reaching the green box and makes the maze seem "impossible". The only purpose is just to mess with people and can simply be removed by pressing the 'A' button.

There is also a red box in the top right corner that will cause the player to lose when they comes into contact with it. 

While on the maze screen, the 'SELECT' button can be pressed to bring the program back to the title screen and the program will continue as if it had been started for the first time.

The program will continue to the win screen if the player reaches the green box on the maze screen within the time limit. From the win screen, one can go back to the title screen by either pressing 'START' or 'SELECT'.

The program will continue to the lose screen if the player does not reach the green box within 60 seconds or if the player touches the red box. From this screen, one can go back to the title screen by either pressing 'START' or 'SELECT'.
